              <p>In this paper, Geiger, who was working with Ernest Rutherford, describes the famous
                "gold foil" experiment. Alpha particles, which are radioactive positively charged
                particles, were emitted from $RaBr_2$. These particles then passed through a $0.9mm$ slit,
                before hitting a photographic screen which detected where the particles landed.
                The control was in vacuum, with nothing covering the slit. For the control,
                a sharp peak of ~ 2 mm width was detected on the screen. To test scattering in
                different material, they tried passing the alpha particles through air, gold foil,
                and aluminum foil. When passed through all three substances, the distribution on
                the screen became more spread out, indicating that scattering occurred. The effect
                was most noticeable when two gold leaves were placed in front of the slit. This
                experiment was important because the scattering of the alpha particles indicated
                that there must some dense collection of positive charge within an atom.

        <h3 class="card-title">What's in an Atom?</h3>
        <p class="card-text">Prior to Rutherford and Geiger's experiment, the atom was thought of as a
          "raisin-bun". People knew that there were negatively charged electrons, somewhere around the
          outside, and that there was a positive charge to balance the negative charge, but that
          was about it. In a paper in 1904
          (<a href='https://timelinefy-space-001.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/files/8/8_I151ITTJWAZ2G1WSHQHHVXOZ9EFQEB1W.pdf'>On the Structure of Atoms</a>),
          JJ Thompson described the atom as "a ring of n negatively electrified particles placed inside a
          uniformly electrified sphere."
        </p>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">negative particles</button>
        &nbsp; It was known that there were negative particles within the atom.
        <br><br>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">positive stuff</button>
        &nbsp; It was known that there was a positive charge in the atom, but it wasn't known
        that this too was from particles.

              Rutherford and Geiger knew that negative $\beta$-particles scattered when passing through matter;
              but what about positive $\alpha$-particles? And if so, what does that say about the structure
              of the atom?

              If $\alpha$-particles were to scatter when passing through matter, this would mean
              that they would have to come into contact with a dense, positively charged "corpuscule."
              At the time, J.J. Thomson's model of the atom predicted that the positive charge
              was not condensed to one place, but rather spread out over the entire atom. Scattering
              would refute this theory.

        <p>
          The premise of this experiment was to shoot a beam of positively-charged
          particles through different materials (solid and gas), and see
          if the beam scattered at all.</p>
          <img src="img/gold-foil-setup.png">
          <br><br>
          <h4>1. $\alpha$-Particles Source: Radium Bromide</h4>
          <p>Firstly, they needed a source of $\alpha$-particles. </p>
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">alpha particles</button>
          &nbsp; Certain large atoms spontaneously produce $\alpha$-particles in
          $\alpha$-decay. They consist of 2 protons + 2 neutrons; a Helium nucleus.
          Of course, at the time, Rutherford and Geiger didn't know they were a Helium nucleus.
          <br><br>
          <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">radium</button>
          &nbsp; Radium is element $88$, and was discovered in $1898$ by Marie and
          Pierre Curie. It was known at the time to produce $\alpha$-particles. So, for
          this experiment, Rutherford and Geiger decided to use radium bromide ($RaBr_2$),
          the salt form, as a source for $\alpha$-particles. In air, $RaBr_2$ glows
          green, due to the radiation interacting with nitrogen in the air.
          <br><br>
          <h4>2. Matrials to Pass Beam Through </h4>
        <p>
          Once they had a source of $\alpha$-particles, they needed to select which materials
          to have the beam pass through. They chose:
        </p>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">control: vacuum</button>
        &nbsp; They needed to have a control material for the experiment, one where
        the $\alpha$-particles wouldn't pass through any atoms, i.e. vacuum.
        <br><br>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">air</button>
        &nbsp; To investigate gas material, they selected air, which is comprised
        of ~80% nitrogen and ~20% oxygen (along with other trace gases).
        <br><br>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">aluminum</button>
        &nbsp; A thin sheet (or leaf, as they call it) of aluminum was selected
        for solid material. In the end, gold performed better, so they didn't include
        aluminum in the final graphs.
        <br><br>
        <button type="button" class="btn btn-outline-info">gold</button>
        &nbsp; The namesake of this experiment, gold foil! Both one and two
        thin sheets of gold were used.
